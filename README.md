This is a cool advanced calculator made with python. It first asks the user if they want to add, subtract, multiply or devide. It then asks them for 2 numbers then it will either add, subtract, multipy, or devide them depending what you entered in step one. There is also a seecret menu if you keep hitting space a few times that will ask for a nubmer and then will ask you if you are finding the area of a circle. If you are it will multipy your number by itself then multipy it by 3.14 to get the area. If you said no it will multipy your number by 3.14 to get the circumfrencce of the circle. I made this code when I was 13 years old when we were doing a lot of math with circles. I made this code because I hated having to manually type all the numbers on my calculator so now all I have to do is enter the numbers on the computer and it will do the math for me.
